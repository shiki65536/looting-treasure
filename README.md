## Notice
- The original idea comes from The Net Ninja's [Build a Memory Game with React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCKohZwGZMw&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iQ7g2eoNXHCJBBBz40S_Lm)
- I coded the whole REACT parts by myself, but after finished the whole project, I tried to watch The Net Ninja's video to refactor some parts of my code.
